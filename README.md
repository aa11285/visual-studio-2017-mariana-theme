# Visual Studio 2017 inspired by SublimeText3 Mariana theme

Visual Studio theme `*.vssettings`

Sublime Text 3 theme `*.tmTheme`

## Color scheme 

Optimized for C++

Not tested on other languages yet

... Still some differences from SublimeText3

## Shortcut key

The `vssettings` file contains all IDE settings so some key combinations are modified to my preference

| command | key |
|---|---|
|comment	  | Ctrl+/  |
|uncomment	| Ctrl+TÂ |
|format		| Ctrl+Shift+L|
|Build		| F7|
|Build All	| Ctrl+Shift+F7|
